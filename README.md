This zip contains all of the board, library and schematic files for Autodesk Eagle CADsoft to create a single-board solution.
This single-board solution fits into a waterproof off-the-shelf enclosure.
The enclosure is from Hammond Manufacturing PN 1554R2GYCL. This enclosure is 6.2 x 6.2 x 3" with a transparent polycarb cover.
A related repo contains board files for a functionally identical two-board solution that fits into a 2" PVC pipe. The two-board tubular solution requires
some custom 3D printed parts that fit over the PVC pipe. Fusion360 models for the pipe cover parts are in a related repo.
